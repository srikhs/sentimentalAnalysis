This script uses the breaking_bad_tweets.csv file.
The csv file contains two columns, one with the username and the another with the tweet
I am getting the username of the users and storing it in a set. It will have 12 users.
I am storing the tweets in a list and I am marking the tweet ranges by the users in another list. This list includes the range of index of all the tweets of particular user.
Then, I am calculating the scores using the dictionary value.
This gives the output as above.
